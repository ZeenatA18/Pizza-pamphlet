                            The District Six Museum Foundation was not established until 1989.
                            It was established in 1994.
                            The museum is reminiscent of the once vibrant multi-ethnic areas that were forcibly removed
                            during apartheid in the 1960s and 1970s.
                            The area of ​​District 6 is partially divided into the suburbs of Walmer Estate, Sonnebloom,
                            and Lower Blade, the rest of which is generally undeveloped land.

                            Cape Town City Hall is a large Edwardian building in Cape Town city centre which was built
                            in 1905.
                            It is located on the Grand Parade to the west of the Castle and is built from honey-coloured
                            oolitic limestone imported from Bath in England.
                            The building was designed as the result of a public competition.
