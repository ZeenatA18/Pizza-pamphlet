            <h5>District Six Museum</h5>
            <img src="District6.jpg" alt="district">
            <p>The District Six Museum Foundation was only established in 1989, and the museum itself came into being in 1994.
                Currently, the museum serves as a remembrance of the once lively multi-racial area that was forcefully removed during apartheid in the 1960s and 1970s.
                Over 60,000 of its inhabitants were forcibly removed during the 1970s by the apartheid regime.
                The area of District Six is now partly divided between the suburbs of Walmer Estate, Zonnebloem, and Lower Vrede, while the rest is generally undeveloped land.</p>
            <h5>City Hall</h5>
            <img src="cityhall.webp" alt="cityhall">
            <p>Cape Town City Hall is a large Edwardian building in Cape Town city centre which was built in 1905. It is located on the Grand Parade to the west of the Castle and is built from honey-coloured oolitic limestone imported from Bath in England.
                    The building was designed as the result of a public competition, the winning architects being Messrs Harry Austin Reid and Frederick George Green, with the contractors being Messrs T. Howard and F. G. Scott.
                    Much of the building material, including fixtures and fittings was imported from Europe.</p>
